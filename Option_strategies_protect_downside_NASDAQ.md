📈 Here Are Three Options Strategies That Will Protect Your Downside But Keep Your Upside

1️⃣ “Put spread”

A put spread involves buying a put option while simultaneously selling another put option with a lower strike price to reduce the cost. This hedging strategy limits your maximum loss to the premium paid, while allowing you to benefit if the price of the underlying asset falls.

What’s the payoff when you add 100 shares in the Nasdaq?

A put spread combined with 100 shares in the Nasdaq will significantly reduce your downside risk while sacrificing only a small portion of the upside, making it suitable for those anticipating a short-term correction but still wanting exposure to potential gains.

Using recent data, buying a put spread on 100 shares of the Nasdaq ETF QQQ costs just $530. While you’d lose $10’500 on your Nasdaq position if prices drop by 20%, you’d gain $4’500 on your hedge, significantly cutting your downside.

2️⃣ Put-spread collar

To further reduce protection costs, consider the put-spread collar strategy. By selling a call to finance the put spread, you can potentially make your hedge completely free at inception. With this strategy, falling prices can yield gains of up to $5,000 if they drop by 20%.

What’s the payoff when you add 100 shares in the Nasdaq? Rising prices mean that you’d lose money on your put-spread collar. Those losses would offset gains in your underlying Nasdaq shares, meaning your gains would be capped after a rise of about 10% (until August 2023). However, your losses would be reduced by even more than the put spread strategy if prices fall.

3️⃣ A 1x2 Strategy

In the 1x2 strategy, you sell a slightly out-of-the-money put option and use the proceeds to buy two lower-strike puts. This approach is cheaper because the lower-strike puts are less likely to be exercised. While there is still a potential for loss if markets fall between the strike prices, the loss is limited. On the other hand, if prices collapse, the upside can be significant.

What’s the payoff when you add 100 shares in the Nasdaq? Should prices drop between your two strike prices, you’d experience a maximum loss of $2000 at expiration (it’d be lower before expiration). That means that you’d suffer a worse loss than if you were just holding the Nasdaq. That being said, your gains in the event of a larger fall in prices means that your total position would be completely hedged if prices dropped by more than 20%.

🤔So which one’s for you?

>> If you want to protect your downside at a small cost, the put spread is probably your best bet. 
>> If you’re willing to give up some upside get a free – and slightly improved – downside protection, the put-spread collar might be for you. 
>>If you think a really big crash is unavoidable, then consider the 1x2.
