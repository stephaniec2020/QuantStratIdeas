## Data Science and Quantitative Finance Learning Path
### Author: Vivek Viswanathan
This Markdown (md) file outlines a learning path for data science and quantitative finance, focusing on various libraries, concepts, and resources. Follow these steps to enhance your skills in the field:

### Programming Libraries
- **Numpy**: Focus on understanding and utilizing Numpy for efficient numerical calculations and data manipulation.
- **XGBoost**: Learn about XGBoost and similar gradient boosting algorithms, which are widely used in machine learning for tabular data.
- **Scikit-learn**: Explore Scikit-learn, a powerful library for machine learning and statistical modeling, and understand its functionalities for building predictive models.
- **CVXPY**: Get acquainted with CVXPY for convex optimization tasks. Although you may require more complex libraries eventually, CVXPY is an excellent starting point.
- **PEP-8 Styling**: Adopt the PEP-8 styling guidelines for your code. Pay attention to your IDE's suggestions and warnings to ensure compliance with PEP-8.

### Math and Statistics Courses
Take the following math and statistics courses to establish a strong foundation:
- Calculus
- Differential Equations
- Linear Algebra
- Probability
- Statistics
- Econometrics
Explore these subjects thoroughly to gain a deep understanding of their principles and applications.

### Investment Analysis
Develop a solid understanding of investment analysis by following these steps:

Read **Reilly and Brown's Investment Analysis and Portfolio Management** to learn about investment strategies and portfolio management techniques.

If you're interested in derivatives, read the **Hull** book. For fixed income, read the **Fabozzi** book.

### Code Organization and Best Practices
Learn how to write clean and well-organized code. Instead of relying on prescriptive books, adopt the coding style of popular projects on GitHub to enhance your skills in code organization.

### Machine Learning for Tabular Data
Focus on machine learning techniques with an emphasis on tabular data. Follow these steps:

- Elastic Net, XGBoost, and random forest are commonly used models for tabular data. Learn about them and understand their implementation.

- Avoid overemphasizing deep learning. While deep learning has its applications, its importance is often exaggerated. Focus on its specific use cases, such as sentiment analysis or satellite imagery analysis.

- Read **Stefan Jansen's Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading** to gain insights into applying machine learning techniques in finance.

### Constrained Mean-Variance Optimization
Learn how to build constrained mean-variance optimal portfolios by incorporating trading costs. Follow these steps:

- Learn different approaches for calculating covariance, including shrinkage methods.

- Understand how to implement individual stock and group constraints, as this is crucial in practice.

- Incorporate trading costs into your optimization framework to account for realistic scenarios.

### Standard Signals and Basic Financial Accounting
If you're interested in lower frequency strategies, familiarize yourself with standard signals and basic financial accounting:

- Gain a basic understanding of financial accounting principles.

- Read the appendix of **Hou, Xue, and Zhang's "Replicating Anomalies"** to learn about standard signals used in quantitative finance.

### Web Scraping with Selenium
Learn web scraping using Selenium, a popular web automation tool. Follow these steps:

- Understand how to traverse the Document Object Model (DOM) using either XPath or CSS selectors.

- Practice web scraping on a single website to grasp the underlying concepts.

### Project: Predicting Returns
Undertake a small project to predict returns. Follow these guidelines:

Use standard data for your analysis, supplemented with one alternative data signal. It's important to have a solid understanding of standard signals, cross-validation, and optimization before delving into alternative data.

Once completed, showcase your project by publishing it on GitHub
